The Oslo-Bergen tagger is licenced under the GNU General Public
licence, version 2, see the file LICENCE in this directory. For more
information on the Oslo-Bergen tagger, see
http://www.hf.uio.no/tekstlab/English/tagger.html

The files in this directory are the unconverted versions of the
current Oslo-Bergen tagger CG rules, see the file
../OBT-to-Apertium.sh for some information on conversion. Also note
that these are in latin1, so you'll have to do something like

$ recode l1..u8 nn_morf.cg

before using them.

In bm_morf.cg you have to remove a ' from line 16861, in bm_synt.cg a
\ from LIST ikke-sanns-adj (line 877), and in nn_morf.cg comment out
line 3965 ("Nytt nummer!!") to get them to run as they are. We keep
these files unchanged from the University of Oslo-versions so that
it's easy to diff when they release a new version.

http://maximos.aksis.uib.no/Aksis-wiki/Oslo-Bergen_Tagger has a binary
version of the OBT multitagger, while
http://svn.emmtee.net/tags/topp/uib/lisp/ (especially the
subdirectories projects/cgp and projects/morph ) seems to contain the
source.
