ERROR: Please supply two file names.

USAGE:

$ $0 before.txt after.txt

to view word-differences between before.txt and after.txt, or

$ $0 before.txt after.txt 7

to keep showing updated word-differences between before.txt and after.txt
every 7 seconds (for example).

The files may be of different lengths â€“ this program will only show
differences in the first N lines where N is the shortest of the
line-lengths of the files. So you can run corpus tests in one terminal
and use this program in a different terminal to view in-progress
results as they happen.
