ERROR: Missing -t and -r arguments.

Usage: Run this script with the same parameters as you would give
apertium-eval-translator.pl when running it without -beam, e.g.:

$0 -t test.txt -r ref.txt

This script will keep running apertium-eval-translator.pl with
doubling sizes of the -beam parameter until the result seems stable.
