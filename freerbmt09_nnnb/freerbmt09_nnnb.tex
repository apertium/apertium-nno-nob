\begin{abstract}

  This article has a very long title, which should probably be snappier and more enticing since we want people to read the abstract to find out what it's really all about.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}

The Oslo-Bergen Tagger \citep{hagen2000cbt}
\section{Design}
\label{sec-2}

The nn-nb module follows the design of the Apertium
system\citep{todo}, a shallow-transfer pipeline system. Apertium is
quite modular, and nn-nb differs from most of the other language pairs
in using a Constraint Grammar morphological disambiguator.
\section{Development}
\label{sec-3}

(Ie. the GsoC process?)
\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec-4}

We define naïve coverage as the proportion of words in a corpus which
are given at least one analysis by our monolingual
dictionaries. Testing on Nynorsk Wikipedia (5116174 words) and Bokmål
Wikipedia (27529115 words), we have 89.6\% and 88.2\% coverage,
respectively.

The Word Error Rate (WER) on a 3750 word Wikipedia article on
linguistics in the Bokmål to Nynorsk direction was 22.06\% when
including unknown words, although since 64.93\% of these were
free-rides (ie. the same in Bokmål and Nynorsk) anyway, the final WER
was 10.71\%. Typical free-rides include names, loan-words and special
terminology.

\item Qualitative assessment\ldots{}
\item anything else?
\end{itemize}
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item We don't have any sort of compound handling, probably we could
  analyse a whole lot more with a trie or whatever, but there's also a
  compound handler in OBT that might be possible to integrate.
\item ``Well-written'' nynorsk uses lots of periphrasis and MWE's, eg. particle
  verbs; we don't generate any such thing. A syntactic analysis might
  be useful here, although without being quite certain of where the
  relevant phrase ends, it'll be safer to stick with non-discontinuous
  target language translations.
\end{itemize}
